# RHEMA
This is a project for both Soronko Academy and PREMEST.

It entails the use of React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB to build a Full Stack Learning Application - from start to finish. The App is named RHEMA, considering its latin origin, which is 'word'. This app serves as a platform for facilitators looking to be employed and learners looking for the right educational content to exchange words and build on them to improve their lives.
